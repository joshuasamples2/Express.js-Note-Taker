# Express.js-Note-Taker


## Overview
 Express.js is a widely used Node.js framework, to handle different HTTP methods in an API route. Well-designed routes help us handle responses when a client makes requests to a specific endpoint or URL. Previously, we used the Fetch API on the front end to make GET requests to third-party APIs.
